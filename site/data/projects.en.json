GenAI makes this especially interesting: it enables more adaptive, personalized interfaces and behaviors, closer to what you might think of as early GenUI. These projects are a mix of explorations and longer-term builds, focused on practical use, thoughtful design, and learning by doing rather than chasing novelty.",

            "longDescription": "Chronimo is a focused time-tracking app designed for creative and knowledge work. Track time across Projects, break work down into Tasks, and log Sessions with one-tap start/stop. The Home screen combines a work-hours status donut (worked vs planned time) with quick access to your most recent or pinned tasks and a categorized projects list. Each project rolls up totals across its tasks, and each task provides an editable session log so you can correct mistimed or forgotten tracking.\n\nChronimo is local-first with no dedicated backend: data lives on-device and is intended to sync via iCloud across your Apple devices. It stays usable offline, supports a floating active-session card for rapid control, and aims to support lock screen start/stop controls in native builds. Settings include work-hours scheduling (driving the donut), time display formatting, project categories management, and export options (CSV + database export in native builds).",

TelemetryDeck is used only for aggregated, feature-based usage events (e.g., which screens or actions are used) and is not used for advertising, personalization, or user profiling. We do not send names, email addresses, precise location, contacts, advertising identifiers, or any other directly identifying information to TelemetryDeck.
