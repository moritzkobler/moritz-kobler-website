We developed a large data collection called 'signals' and used that to develop different apps like 'insights', 'trends' etc. for Itonics's innovation management suite. He was excellent on that product. He started from scratch and successfully led the product to market. He always had answers for every type of questions around that product, always ready with product specifications and was always up to date with latest tools and technologies involved in the product like big data, AI and machine learning. Besides that, he was also handling other core products with other teams as well and was excellent on all of those. Moritz is very hard working, self-motivated, results oriented product manager with solid ideas about products he is developing. Highly Recommended!!"

He immersed himself 100% in our suite of cloud apps and helped the scrum teams find their way through plannings and product specifications. The dynamic between product and engineering was always positive and helped keep backlog items prioritised correctly! Moritz gets many bonus points for being very knowledgable on the tech side of things! His understanding of all things code was very helpful when communicating product requirements. On a side note: His weird obsession with flexbox was a bright light in the dark world of responsive CSS! I wish Moritz all the best in his future endeavours and already envy his future colleagues - you won't find a better fit!"

Mo has the perfect balance between being very Germanic in precision, time management, and hitting deadlines and the motivation, team spirit, laughs and fun every team needs to enjoy the day-to-day operations and take everything to the next level. Mo has excellent time management and communication skills. Even during intense crunch periods, he had the drive for keeping everyone motivated, focussed, and productive. We miss his energy and smiles! Every company would be lucky to have Mo, and I couldn’t recommend him more to any team looking for a brilliant product manager, growth hacker, digitization genius and more."

His ability to present his ideas in a constructive way and also collaborate with the team has been always admirable. No matter how difficult it was to present at the meetings, he would always ace it at the end. We are very grateful that he had been there with us and I feel like he would be a precious gem to any company he would step into."
